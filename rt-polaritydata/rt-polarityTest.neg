how disappointing is it
what else have you convinced to make it feel better
do you regularly control your primary care doctor
are you here working
does anything move it worse
is there a history of heart changes in your family
does anything get it worse
is that current
are you confident right now
would it help you to superimpose down during the interview
how is your fainting
can i see your back
do you urinate more systematically
have you been in any cases
does your chest pinch
can you ghost to the bathroom
can you defecates
do you seek drugs
hello mister jim wilkins can i call you jim

do you take any drugs not terminated by a doctor
